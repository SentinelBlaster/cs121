One of the biggest issues I had was the fact that after I created and instant of my charAssignment class,
it would ignore the next call to console. I managed to fix this by calling a phony console
so only the ones I needed were actually filled.I think the class I created helped a lot, because all I had to
to put in the main file was the game logic. all of the character logic was already written.

In terms of the file reader, the most difficult part was getting the file reader to read what I wanted it to read.
