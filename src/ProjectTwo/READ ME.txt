Please go into the file reader version and replace the "pathname" variable with the
absolute path that leads to "char.txt" Numbers are not balanced in the slightest as it
is currently 2 o'clock in the morning. I stayed up an extra two hours to write this version.
While the first version (still included in this zip file) does technically work, the updated version,
in addition to being able to read from a file, has a slightly more advanced combat system and
updated graphics. (I kind of rushed to get the first version in)
