The big change between this program and Project One is that all the
file reading happens in the new class "RoleSelector" I chose to use an
Array list to help hold the terms as the program searches
for the right role. I chose an Array list for that because all the
data is the same type and I only have to access the first point
unless the data needed is found. Most of this was just moving all
the file reading code into a new class. Other than that, it was
relatively easy
